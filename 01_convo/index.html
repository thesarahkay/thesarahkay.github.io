                    <h2>Dialogue in Literature</h2>
                    <h3>APR 2016</h3>
                    <h3>Designed and compiled by Sarah Kay Miller, with data cleaning by <a href="derekgunthermiller.info" target="_blank">Derek Miller</a></h3>
                    <p>How much of a book if conversation? Does it vary between nations? Does an author write the same proportion of dialogue throughout all of their novels? With a few lines of code, we were able to count how many words were in a novel, as well as how many words were in between quotation marks (this is what is considered "dialogue"). It turns out there is quite a spectrum of dialogue in classic novels, with the average proportion of conversation being 45%.</p>
                    <p>Texts were downloaded from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/" target="_blank">gutenberg.org.</a> Data cleaned using Python. Designed and compiled with <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> (Java) and InDesign.
